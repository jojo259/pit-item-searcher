# pit-item-searcher
searches for items in hypixel: the pit using usernames from pitpanda leaderboards

currently set to find dark pants with 150+ lives, most of the data for items is already found inside checkItem so you can modify it to search for other things easily (item name, count, enchants, nonce, lives, max lives, tier, gemmed)
