# pit-item-searcher
searches for items in hypixel: the pit using usernames from pitpanda leaderboards

currently set to find dark pants with 150+ lives

most of the data for items is already found inside checkItem so you can modify it to search for other things easily (item name, count, enchants, nonce, lives, max lives, tier, gemmed)

takes like... 2 days to search through all the accounts due to the api ratelimit (120 accounts / min) so if you want to do anything more than search for some items a couple of times i would recommend setting up a database instead of running one-time searches

needs a couple of modules idk run it and find out
